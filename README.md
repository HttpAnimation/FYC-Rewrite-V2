# FYC-Rewrite-V2/main

FYC is a torrent hub for all things torrents without sailing the seas.

## README
GitHub is showing the readme from main/README.md if you are seeing this while one of the main branches heads over the README.md file branch for now while I try to find a fix I have no idea why this happens.

## Installing
To install FYC open a terminal and type the following command listed below note that [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows?r=1) is not tested.
