# FYC-Rewrite V2
FYC is a way for loading json data for torrent's FYC is not made for piracy so just don't use it for that UwU.

## Installing
If you would like to install a version go over this [file](Installers.md) and that will have all the commands for installing all versions if you would like the newest stable tho heres the install command just a open a terminal and run the command.

```bash
mkdir V1 && cd V1 && git clone -b Version-1 https://github.com/HttpAnimation/FYC-Rewrite-V2.git && cd ../ && echo 'Version one has been install'
```

## Repos
Repos are the way of getting data into FYC as of writing this I have not made the documantion for making a repo but it will soon be in place if you would like to make a repo already you can look at this [branch](https://github.com/HttpAnimation/FYC-Rewrite-V2) for doing so. There is already a defualt Repo in FYC witch is where all verifed repos are in.

## Report issues
Ff you would like to report a issue head over the issue page witch can be found [here](https://github.com/HttpAnimation/FYC-Rewrite-V2/issues).

## Known issues
Here is a list of known issues am working on.

1) The stream button does not show up even when the string is true.

2) All other repos but Movies don't work.

## Streaming
If you would like to stream you're FYC page you can do on of the following.

1) Fork this repo
2) Host a netowrk site

Now each one has some draw backs and gains.

## Streaming/Forking - info
Forking the repo is really useful when you either have a pc you can't use for running a light wight server or you don't have the abilty to use Linux/macOS in witch case you would want to fork the repo but when you do know this **EVERYONE CAN SEE YOU'RE SITE** witch means github can also see the site so you can't have anything on it that breaks the [Github TOS](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) and if you do break them you can get banned from Github witch really sucks so just keep it normal like stuff you would find on [Archive](archive.org) as you don't wanna be sailing the high seas mate ;). 

## Streaming/Hosting - info
This is the best way of having a FYC but it has a little bit of downers so first of all no one can see you're site if they are not on you're network so don't just send you're mate a url on [Discord](https://discord.com) with you're ip and port on it beacuse it's not gonna work for that you will need a fork or to port forawrd witch I have no idea how to do. You will also need a pc running Linux now I would recommand [Ubuntu server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) or [Debian 12](https://www.debian.org/News/2023/20230610) also [macOS](apple.com) can be used but I have not really tested it out so some stuff might not work right  but **[Windows](microsoft.com) OR [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) CAN NOT AND WILL NOT WORK** but besides these desides this is gonna be the best way of having a site.
