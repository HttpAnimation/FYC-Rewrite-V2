## Mods
Mods are a way to add stuff to FYC even if something happens with every repo in the world. To add a mod open the FYC-Rewrite V2 folder which is most likely stored here **/home/$user** then open the Mods folder and drag and drop the folder of your mod into there then compile if you would like to make a mod read [this](https://github.com/HttpAnimation/FYC-Rewrite-V2/blob/Mod-Docs/README.md) page you can only compile mods with [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) and Linux [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) will not work [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) will work tho.
```bash
bash Compile.sh
```
if you need to allow it to run on your distro 
```bash
chmod +x Compile.sh
```
